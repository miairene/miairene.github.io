Music video for single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28nhcCG8lIQ">'Goliath'</a> by The Living Tombstone.

"Probably the greatest visuals in a music video Iâ€™ve ever seen. When ever I see a music video it takes away from the experience because it gives the song a visual form and limits interpretation. The visuals in this music video do not do that to me" - just a very nice youtube comment :)
